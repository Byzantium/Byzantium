# TODO:
# - In Gateways.activate(), add some code before running iptables to make sure
#   that NAT rules don't exist already.
#   iptables -t nat -n -L | grep MASQUERADE
# - Add code to configure encryption on wireless gateways.
# - Make it possible to specify IP configuration information on a wireless
#   uplink.
# - Add code to update_network_interfaces() to delete interfaces from the
#   database if they don't exist anymore.

# Import external modules.
