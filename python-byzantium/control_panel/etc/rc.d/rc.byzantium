# rc.byzantium - Initscript called at boot-time when runlevel 3 is entered (the
#	default).  Here, long-running scripts and daemons will be started that are
#	directly involved in Byzantium.  Other things (like optional system services)
#	will be controlled by other initscripts, just not at boot-time.

# Start the Byzantium control panel in a loop to ensure that it stays running.
# Consider using supervise to keep an eye on it.
