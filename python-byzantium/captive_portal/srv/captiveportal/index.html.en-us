<title>Welcome to Byzantium.</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You have connected to Byzantium, an ad-hoc wireless mesh network.  If you're seeing this, then chances are that
Internet access where you are has either been cut off, or is compromised somehow, and someone has decided that it's too
dangerous to use.</p>

<p>If there is no gateway from the mesh to the Internet, then you will not have access to most online services.  Byzantium
has a number of replacements for commonly used websites (such as Twitter, Gchat, and Etherpad) that we hope will help people
exchange information and organize.  Please be careful: You can never be certain of who you're talking to, so use discretion
when posting information, and unless you are absolutely certain of who someone is, do not give your real name or location.
The life you save could be your own.</p>

<p>If there is a gateway to the Internet, this node will inform you of this fact, and you will be able to access the rest of
the Internet normally.</p>

<p>Be careful, and good luck.</p>
