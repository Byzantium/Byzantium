# bmx_uci_config plugin depends on the UCI (universial configuration interface)
# from http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/uci-0.7.3.tar.gz
# to compile first install uci: 
#	wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/uci-0.7.3.tar.gz
#	tar xzvf uci-0.7.3.tar.gz; cd uci-0.7.3; make; sudo make install
#
#
# the default location for this config file is /etc/config/bmx
# from where it would be loaded automatically during initialization of bmxd.
# Use bmxd -f /etc/config/another-bmx-config to load an alternative config file.
# and bmxd -f 0 to disable all config-file functionality.
#
# You may also start bmxd as you always did (e.g. bmxd --neta -o 1000 ath0:bmx)
# and then use bmxd -c show-config and bmxd -c show-config > /etc/config/bmx
# to generate the config file you need. Afterwards a simple $ bmxd should do it.
#
# With uci comes a bunch of new configuration possibilities:
# The bmxd can be configured on-the-fly from bmxd or uci.
# To configure from bmxd simply type: bmxd -c ogm_interval=500  or: bmxd -co500
# To configure from uci: uci set bmx.general.ogm_interval=500
#	followed by: kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/pid) or: bmxd -c reload-config
# To permanently store the changes: uci commit bmx
# And to revert them: uci revert bmx
# For more possibilities check out openWrt, UCI, and bmxd -X


# the following example substitutes the now deprecated --neta option
#
config 'bmx6' 'general'
#       option 'runtime_dir' '/var/run/bmx6'
	option 'base_port' '6240'


# bmxd always tries to load bmx6_config.so from /usr/lib/
# Therefore, there is no obligation to request this explicitly.
# An alternative library-path can be set with the environment variable BMX6_LIB_PATH
# E.g. BMX6_LIB_PATH=/usr/src/bmx6/lib will check the given directory for plugins
config 'plugin'
	option 'plugin' 'bmx6_config.so'


# other plugin must be requested explicitly:
# config 'plugin'
# 	option 'plugin' 'bmx6_howto_plugin.so'


# it is allways a good idea to use an alias on your loopback interface 
# as the primary interface because the loopback interface is probably 
# the most stable you have on your system and then you are always 
# reachable under your primary IP. E.g.:
# ifconfig lo:bmx 6.6.1.1 netmask 255.255.0.0
config 'dev'
	option 'dev' 'lo:bmx'


# Of course, a real interface is necessary
# to link up with the rest of the world.
# However, all non-primary interfaces may be added and removed on the fly.
config 'dev'
	option 'dev' 'ath0:bmx'


# In openWrt interfaces are usually configured in /etc/config/network
# to avoid redundancy it is also possible to resolve values from there. E.g.:
#
#config 'dev'
# 	option 'dev' 'ref:network.lan0_bmx.ifname'





# unicast host-network announcements (HNAs) may look like this:
# config 'unicast_hna'
#       option 'unicast_hna' '106.1.2.4/32'
