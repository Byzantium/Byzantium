The Python module called sh (https://github.com/amoffat/sh) lets you call just about anything
that you could run from a login shell much more neatly than you can with subprocess.Popen, and
more importantly lets you capture and parse the output much more readily.  You use it like this:

    from sh import ifconfig
    print ifconfig("eth0")

Whatever command you want to run is imported like any other module.  That command is then usable
just like a Python statement.  Arguments are passed per usual, and output can be captured and
worked with in a like fashion.

It's written for Python v2.6 - v3.2, so future compatibility shouldn't be a problem.
