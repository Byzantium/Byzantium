#
# This is a sample configuration file for the ngIRCd IRC daemon, which must
# be customized to the local preferences and needs.
#
# Comments are started with "#" or ";".
#
# A lot of configuration options in this file start with a ";". You have
# to remove the ";" in front of each variable to actually set a value!
# The disabled variables are shown with example values for completeness only
# and the daemon is using compiled-in default settings.
#
# Use "ngircd --configtest" (see manual page ngircd(8)) to validate that the
# server interprets the configuration file as expected!
#
# Please see ngircd.conf(5) for a complete list of configuration options.

[Global]
	# The [Global] section of this file is used to define the main
	# configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports
	# on which the server should be listening.

	# Server name in the IRC network, must contain at least one dot
	# (".") and be unique in the IRC network. Required!

	# Syslog "facility" to which ngIRCd should send log messages.
	# Possible values are system dependant, but most probably auth, daemon,

	# i. e. the Directory the pidfile resides in must be writeable by
	# the ngircd user and exist in the chroot directory.
	#
	# Note that this directory has to exist so that the daemon can write its PID
	# file because it doesn't do that until after it drops its privileges.

[Server]
	# Other servers are configured in [Server] sections. If you
	# configure a port for the connection, then this ngircd tries to
	# connect to to the other server on the given port; if not it waits
	# for the other server to connect.
	# There may be more than one server block, one for each server.
	#
	# Server Groups:
	# The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every
	# server with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a
	# group won't answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server
	# in the given group. But the ngircd never tries to connect to two
	# servers with the same group ID.

	# IRC name of the remote server, must match the "Name" variable in
	# the [Global] section of the other server (when using ngIRCd).
	;Name = irc2.the.net

	# this server should establish the connection).

	# configured as "MyPassword" on the other server.
	;PeerPassword = PeerSecret

	# Group of this server (optional)
	;Group = 123

	# Set the "Passive" option to "yes" if you don't want this ngIRCd to
	# connect to the configured peer (same as leaving the "Port" variable
	# empty). The advantage of this option is that you can actually
	# configure a port an use the IRC command CONNECT more easily to
	# manually connect this specific server later.
	;Passive = no

	# Connect to the remote server using TLS/SSL (Default: false)
	SSLConnect = yes

	# Define a (case insensitive) mask matching nick names that should be
	# treated as IRC services when introduced via this remote server.
	# REGULAR SERVERS DON'T NEED this parameter, so leave it empty
	# (which is the default).
	# When you are connecting IRC services which mask as a IRC server
	# and which use "virtual users" to communicate with, for example
	# "NickServ" and "ChanServ", you should set this parameter to
	# something like "*Serv".
	;ServiceMask = *Serv

[Channel]
	# Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections.
	# Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
	# persist when there are no more members left.
	# Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
	# and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
	# There may be more than one [Channel] block, one for each channel.

	# Name of the channel
	Name = #Byzantium

	# Topic for this channel
