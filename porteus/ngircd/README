ngircd (Next Generation IRC Daemon)

ngIRCd is a portable IRC daemon written from scratch.  It is easy to
configure, supports server links (even with original ircds), and runs
on hosts with changing IP addresses (such as dial-in networks).

This defaults to using gnutls for SSL support; if you prefer to use
openssl (which will result in a non-redistributable package), then
pass "SSLTYPE=openssl" to the script when running it.
