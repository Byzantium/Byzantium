# ifplugd configuration file

# Please note that this is a bourne shell fragment sourced by the
# init script of ifplugd.

# Specify the interfaces to control here, separated by spaces.
# Ifplugd processes will be started for each of these interfaces when
# the ifplugd init script is called with the "start" argument. You may
# use the magic string "auto" to make the init script start or stop
# ifplugd processes for ALL eth and wlan interfaces that are available
# according to /proc/net/dev. Note that the list of interfaces
# appearing in /proc/net/dev may depend on which kernel modules you
# have loaded.
# Because ifplugd will grab onto wireless interfaces as well, we can't trust the 'auto'
# keyword.
INTERFACES="eth0 eth1 eth2 eth3 eth4 eth5"

# Additional parameters for ifplugd.
# (Run "ifplugd -h" for further information.)
ARGS="-fwI -u0 -d10 -r /usr/local/sbin/ethernet.py -M"

# Additional parameters for ifplugd for the specified interface.  Note
# that $ARGS is ignored, when a variable like this is set for an
# interface
#ARGS_wlan0="-MwI -u5 -d5"
