# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ifplugd: ifplugd (automatically configuration of ethernet interfaces)
ifplugd:
ifplugd: ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure your
ifplugd: ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and automatically
ifplugd: unconfigure it if the cable is pulled. This is useful on laptops
ifplugd: with onboard network adapters, since it will only configure the
ifplugd: interface when a cable is really connected.
ifplugd: ifplugd interfaces with your distribution's native network
ifplugd: configuration utilities.
