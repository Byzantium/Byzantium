SQLite Database Browser is a freeware, public domain, open source visual
tool used to create, design and edit database files compatible with
SQLite. It is meant to be used for users and developers that want to
create databases, edit and search data using a familiar spreadsheet-like
interface, without the need to learn complicated SQL commands.
