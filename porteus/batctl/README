batctl (B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced control and management tool)

The B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced routing protocol has been included in the
Linux kernel since 2.6.38, however the kernel module is only part of
of the implementation. In order to create and configure mesh networks
using the B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced protocol you need the batctl userland
tool.

Since B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced operates on layer 2 the common diagnosis
tools do not work as expected. To solve this, batctl provides
alternatives for ping, traceroute, and tcpdump.
