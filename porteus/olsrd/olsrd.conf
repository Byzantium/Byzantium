  # When multiple links exist between hosts
  # the weight of interface is used to determine
  # the link to use. Normally the weight is
  # automatically calculated by olsrd based
  # on the characteristics of the interface,
  # but here you can specify a fixed value.
  # Olsrd will choose links with the lowest value.

  #Weight 0


  # If a certain route should be preferred 
  # or ignored by the mesh, the Link Quality 
  # value of a node can be multiplied with a factor 
  # entered here. In the example the route 
  # using 192.168.0.1 would rather be ignored.
  # A multiplier of 0.5 will result in a small
  # (bad) LinkQuality value and a high (bad)
  # ETX value.

  #LinkQualityMult 192.168.0.1 0.5

  # This multiplier applies to all other nodes 
  # LinkQualityMult default 0.8
