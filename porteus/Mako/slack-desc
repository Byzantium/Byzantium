# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

Mako: Mako (A python templating language)
Mako:
Mako: Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar,
Mako: non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum
Mako: performance. Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many
Mako: others, including Django templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi.
Mako: Conceptually, Mako is an embedded Python (i.e. Python Server Page)
Mako: language, which refines the familiar ideas of componentized layout and
Mako: inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward and flexible
Mako: models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python.
