# This script is run by dhcpcd after it gets a configuration for an Ethernet
# interface.  By making it a static route it becomes exportable across the
# mesh by babeld.

# Sitwon wrote this code for /usr/local/sbin/gateway.sh but The Doctor
# transplanted it in here so that there is more control over the exportation
# of the default route, specifically for its re-exportation in the event that
# the cable is disconnected and later reconnected.

# All of this is, of course, for Project Byzantium.

# Hardcode a path to the ip utility.
IP=/sbin/ip

# Extract the default route.
ROUTE=$($IP route show | grep 'default' | grep "$INTERFACE")

# Make the default route exportable.
if [ "x" != "x$ROUTE" ]; then
    sh -c "$IP route del $ROUTE"
    sh -c "$IP route add $ROUTE proto static"
    fi

# Fin.
