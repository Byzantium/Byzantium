# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pybonjour: pybonjour (Pure-Python interface to Apple Bonjour)
pybonjour:
pybonjour: pybonjour provides a pure-Python interface to Apple Bonjour and
pybonjour: compatible DNS-SD libraries (such as Avahi). It allows Python scripts
pybonjour: to take advantage of Zero Configuration Networking (Zeroconf) to
pybonjour: register, discover and resolve services on both local and wide-area
pybonjour: networks. Since pybonjour is implemented in pure Python, scripts that
pybonjour: use it can easily be ported to Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and other
pybonjour: systems that run Bonjour.
