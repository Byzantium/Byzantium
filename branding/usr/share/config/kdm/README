This automatically generated configuration consists of the following files:
- /usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xaccess
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xwilling
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xsetup
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xstartup
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xreset
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xsession
- /usr/share/config/kdm/backgroundrc
All files destined for /usr/share/config/kdm were actually saved in
/dev/shm/package-kdebase/usr/share/config/kdm; this config won't be workable
until moved in place.

Try 'genkdmconf --help' if you want to generate another configuration.
