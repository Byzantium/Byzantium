# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

batman-adv: A loadable kernel module (compiled for v2.6.38.8-porteus) that
batman-adv: implements the BATMAN-advanced mesh routing protocol.  Operates at
batman-adv: layer 2 of the OSI model, moving 802.11 frames where they need to go.
batman-adv: Agnostic insofar as the rest of the OSI stack is concerned.  Requires
batman-adv: the batctl package to configure; without it, you're out of luck.
