Erlang is a general-purpose concurrent programming language and runtime 
system. The sequential subset of Erlang is a functional language, with 
strict evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. It was designed 
by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, 
non-stop applications.
