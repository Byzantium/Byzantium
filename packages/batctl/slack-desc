# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

batctl: using the B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced protocol you need the batctl userland
batctl: tool.
batctl:
batctl: Since B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced operates on layer 2 the common diagnosis
batctl: tools do not work as expected. To solve this, batctl provides
batctl: alternatives for ping, traceroute, and tcpdump.
