nginx [engine x] is a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy
as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.

By default, nginx will use the "nobody" user and group accounts. You may
specify alternate values on the command line if desired; for example:

	NGINXUSER=backup NGINXGROUP=backup ./nginx.SlackBuild

Regardless of which user and group you decide to use, you will need to make
sure they exist on both the build system and the target system.
