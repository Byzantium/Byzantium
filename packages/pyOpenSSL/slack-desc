# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pyOpenSSL: pyOpenSSL (Python wrapper for OpenSSL)
pyOpenSSL:
pyOpenSSL: This module is a rather thin wrapper around (a subset of) the OpenSSL
pyOpenSSL: library. With thin wrapper I mean that a lot of the object methods do
pyOpenSSL: nothing more than calling a corresponding function in the OpenSSL
pyOpenSSL: library
