# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

celt: celt (low delay audio codec)
celt:
celt: CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality
celt: communications. Traditional full-bandwidth  codecs such as Vorbis and
celt: AAC can offer high quality but they require codec delays of hundreds
celt: of milliseconds, which makes them unsuitable  for real-time
celt: interactive applications like teleconferencing. Speech targeted
celt: codecs, such as Speex or G.722, have lower 20-40ms delays but their
celt: speech focus and limited sampling rates restricts their quality,
celt: especially for music.
