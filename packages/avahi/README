Avahi is an implementation of the DNS Service Discovery and Multicast DNS
specifications for Zeroconf Computing.  It uses D-BUS for communication
between user applications and a system daemon.  The daemon is used to
coordinate application efforts in caching replies, necessary to minimize
the traffic imposed on networks.  This kind of technology is already
found in Apple MacOS X (branded Rendezvous Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf)
and is very convenient.

You will need to have an "avahi" user and group on the target system
prior to installing the avahi package.  See README.SBo in this directory
(it is also installed to the package docmentation directory) for more
information and for setup notes.

mono is an optional dependency that also requires gtk-sharp - enable it
with the following:  "MONO=yes ./avahi.SlackBuild"
