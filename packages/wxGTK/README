wxGTK is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's
controls and utilities.

This is a unicode shared build.  If you do not want the unicode build, use:
  UNICODE=NO ./wxGTK.SlackBuild

If you want to include the media library, which provides bindings for
gstreamer, you will need to install GConf first.

This package conflicts with wxPython because wxGTK is already included
there. Both cannot be installed at the same time!
