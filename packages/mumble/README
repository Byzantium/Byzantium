Mumble is a voice chat application for groups. While it can be used
for any kind of activity, it is primarily intended for gaming. It
can be compared to programs like Ventrilo or TeamSpeak. 

If you have g15tools installed and want mumble to use it:
    G15=yes ./mumble.SlackBuild

If you want the mumble overlay:
    OVERLAY=yes ./mumble.SlackBuild

Please note, if you have celt-0.7.1, the previous version of celt on
SBo, you will need to upgrade to celt >= 0.11.0.

This requires: protobuf, speex, and celt >= 0.11.0

Note: This does not build the mumble server (murmur).
