Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python and licensed
under the MIT license.

Twisted projects variously support TCP, UDP, SSL/TLS, multicast, Unix
sockets, a large number of protocols (including HTTP, NNTP, IMAP, SSH,
IRC, FTP, and others), and much more.

This requires zope.interface at runtime.
