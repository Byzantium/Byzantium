# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

protobuf: Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
protobuf: serializing structured data, think XML, but smaller, faster, and
protobuf: simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once,
protobuf: then you can use special generated source code to easily write and
protobuf: read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams
protobuf: and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data
protobuf: structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled
protobuf: against the "old" format.
