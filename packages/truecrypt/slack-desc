# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

truecrypt: it as a real disk. It can encrypt an entire hard disk partition or a
truecrypt: device, such as USB memory stick, floppy disk, etc. It provides two
truecrypt: levels of plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to
truecrypt: reveal the password: 1) Hidden volume 2) No TrueCrypt volume can be
truecrypt: identified. Supports many encryption algorithms.
