TrueCrypt is free open-source disk encryption software for
Windows Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Since version 6.1a of TrueCrypt, a number of header files from RSA
Laboratories are required during the compilation. I've separated the
installation of these into a separate package called cryptoki rather
than have this script extract a separate, isolated archive. 

Thus, to build this version of TrueCrypt, you also need cryptoki, and
to run Truecrypt you need wxGTK. Both are available at SlackBuilds.org.

This script does not create the static GUI build seen elsewhere (see
above for required runtime dependency of wxGTK or similar).

NOTE: There is no direct link to the TrueCrypt source archive, as such, 
it must be downloaded manually from within a web browser.
