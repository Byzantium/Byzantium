Murmur is the VoIP server component for Mumble. Murmur is
installed in a system-wide fashion, but can also be run by
individual users. Each murmur process supports multiple virtual
servers, each with their own user base and channel list.
Administration of murmur is done through D-Bus.

To run murmur at boot, add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.murmur ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.murmur start
fi
