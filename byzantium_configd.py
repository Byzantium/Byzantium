# byzantium_configd.py - A (relatively) simple daemon that automatically
# configures wireless interfaces on a Byzantium node.  No user interaction is
# required.  Much of this code was taken from the control panel, it's just
# been assembled into a more compact form.  The default network settings are
# the same ones used by Commotion Wireless, so this means that our respective
# projects are now seamlessly interoperable.  For the record, we tested this
# in Red Hook in November of 2012 and it works.

# This utility is less of a hack, but it's far from perfect.
