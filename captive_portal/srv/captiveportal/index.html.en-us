<title>Welcome to Byzantium.</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You have connected to Byzantium, an ad-hoc wireless mesh network.  If you're
seeing this, then chances are that Internet access where you are has either
been cut off, or is compromised somehow, and someone has decided that it's too
dangerous to use.</p>

<p>If there is no gateway from the mesh to the Internet, then you will not have
access to most online services.  Byzantium has a number of replacements for
commonly used websites (such as Twitter, Gchat, and Etherpad) that we hope will
help people exchange information and organize.  Please be careful: You can
never be certain of who you're talking to, so use discretion when posting
information, and unless you are absolutely certain of who someone is, do not
give your real name or location.  The life you save could be your own.</p>

<p>If there is a gateway to the Internet, this node will inform you of this
fact, and you will be able to access the rest of the Internet normally.</p>

<p>Some web browsers cache DNS records, which means that you may have problems
after you click the button below.  If you do, please restart your browser.</p>

<p>Be careful, and good luck.</p>
